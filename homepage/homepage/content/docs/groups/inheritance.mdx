# Groups as members

Groups can be added to other groups using the `addMember` method.

When a group is added as a member of another group, members of the parent group will become part of the child group.

## Basic usage

Here's how to add a group as a member of another group:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const playlistGroup = Group.create();
const trackGroup = Group.create();

// Tracks are now visible to the members of playlist
trackGroup.addMember(playlistGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

When you add groups as members:
- Members of the added group become members of the container group
- Their roles are inherited (with some exceptions, see [below](#the-rules-of-role-inheritance))
- Revoking access from the member group also removes its access to the container group

## Levels of inheritance

Adding a group as a member of another is not limited in depth:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const grandParentGroup = Group.create();
const parentGroup = Group.create();
const childGroup = Group.create();

childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);
parentGroup.addMember(grandParentGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

Members of the grandparent group will get access to all descendant groups based on their roles.

## Roles

### The rules of role inheritance

If the account is already a member of the container group, it will get the more permissive role:
<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const parentGroup = Group.create();
parentGroup.addMember(bob, "reader");

const childGroup = Group.create();
parentGroup.addMember(bob, "writer");
childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);

// Bob stays a writer because his role is higher
// than the inherited reader role.
```
</CodeGroup>

When adding a parent group to a child group, only admin, writer and reader roles are inherited:
<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const parentGroup = Group.create();
parentGroup.addMember(bob, "writeOnly");

const childGroup = Group.create();
childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);

// Bob does not become a member of the child group
```
</CodeGroup>

To add a parent group to a child group:

1. The current account must be an admin in the child group
2. The current account must be a member of the parent group

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co, Group } from "jazz-tools";
const group = Group.create();
const Company = co.map({});
const company = Company.create({ owner: group });
// ---cut---
const companyGroup = company._owner.castAs(Group);
const teamGroup = Group.create();

// Works only if I'm a member of `companyGroup`
teamGroup.addMember(companyGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Overriding parent group roles

In some cases you might want to inherit all members from a parent group but override their roles to the same specific role in the child group. You can do so by passing an "override role" as a second argument to `addMember`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const organizationGroup = Group.create();
organizationGroup.addMember(bob, "admin");

const billingGroup = Group.create();

// This way the members of the organization
// can only read the billing data
billingGroup.addMember(organizationGroup, "reader");
```
</CodeGroup>

The "override role" works in both directions:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const alice = await createJazzTestAccount();
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const parentGroup = Group.create();
parentGroup.addMember(bob, "reader");
parentGroup.addMember(alice, "admin");

const childGroup = Group.create();
childGroup.addMember(parentGroup, "writer");

// Bob and Alice are now writers in the child group
```
</CodeGroup>

### Permission changes

When you remove a member from a parent group, they automatically lose access to all child groups. We handle key rotation automatically to ensure security.

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
const parentGroup = Group.create();
// ---cut---
// Remove member from parent
await parentGroup.removeMember(bob);

// Bob loses access to both groups.
// If Bob was also a member of the member group,
// he wouldn't have lost access.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Removing groups from other groups

You can remove a parent group from a child group by using the `removeMember` method:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const parentGroup = Group.create();
const childGroup = Group.create();

childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);

// Revoke the extension
await childGroup.removeMember(parentGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting all parent groups

You can get all the parent groups of a group by calling the `getParentGroups` method:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const childGroup = Group.create();
const parentGroup = Group.create();
childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);

console.log(childGroup.getParentGroups()); // [parentGroup]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example: Team Hierarchy

Here's a practical example of using group inheritance for team permissions:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const CEO = await createJazzTestAccount();
const teamLead = await createJazzTestAccount();
const developer = await createJazzTestAccount();
const client = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
// Company-wide group
const companyGroup = Group.create();
companyGroup.addMember(CEO, "admin");

// Team group with elevated permissions
const teamGroup = Group.create();
teamGroup.addMember(companyGroup); // Inherits company-wide access
teamGroup.addMember(teamLead, "admin");
teamGroup.addMember(developer, "writer");

// Project group with specific permissions
const projectGroup = Group.create();
projectGroup.addMember(teamGroup); // Inherits team permissions
projectGroup.addMember(client, "reader"); // Client can only read project items
```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a hierarchy where:
- The CEO has admin access to everything
- Team members get writer access to team and project content
- Team leads get admin access to team and project content
- The client can only read project content
