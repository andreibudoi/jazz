# Connecting CoValues
CoValues can form relationships with each other by using references (co.ref).
The use of co.ref creates a link from one CoValue to another. Instead of embedding all the details of a related entity directly within a CoValue, you store a reference to its unique identity. This allows multiple CoValues to point to the same piece of data.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// co.ref can be used within CoMap fields to point to other CoValues
class Actor extends CoMap {
    name = co.string;
    imageURL = co.string;
    birthplace = co.ref(Location)
}

//  actual actor data is stored in the separate Actor CoValue
class Movie extends CoMap {
  title = co.string;
  director = co.string;
  cast = co.list(co.ref(Actor)); // ordered, mutable
}

// A User CoMap can maintain a CoFeed of co.ref(Movie) to track their favorite movies
class User extends CoMap {
  username = co.string;
  favoriteMovies = co.feed(co.ref(Movie)); // append-only
}
```
</CodeGroup>

CoList is a collaborative list where each item is a reference to a CoValue while CoFeed contains an append-only list of references to CoValues.

References offer a single source of truth, when you update the CoValue all references to that value are automatically updated, ensuring data consistency across your application.

By connecting CoValues through references, you can build robust and collaborative applications where data is consistent, efficient to manage, and relationships are clearly defined. 
The ability to link different CoValue types to the same underlying data is fundamental to building complex applications with Jazz.
